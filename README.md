## Final Large group project
A project to give power back to tenants! Our site allows users to search rental properties and add reviews based on the condition of their home. Inspired by Glassdoor company reviews. On this project i was an alrounder. First working on the backend getting the database and db fuctions set up then worked on alot of the frontend.
